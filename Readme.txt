This exercise took more than less than 3 hours not 2 hours sharp.
A couple of facts:
1: I needed to explore rss service. Never implement such functionality
2: I didn't get exactly what needed from this part so what I implemented is two endpoint
	1. One returns dummy object I build in memory: 			https://localhost:44321/api/rss/dummy
	2. One return RSS content from third party provider:		https://localhost:44321/api/rss/external?source=https://www.service-public.fr/abonnements/rss/actu-eadministration.rss


best regards
